# Todo-List-Web-App

A simple, interactive Todo List Web Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored in localStorage, ensuring they persist even after refreshing the page.

Persistent Storage : All uncompleted tasks remain visible even after refreshing the page.

Dropdown Filter : View Completed or Uncompleted tasks using the dropdown filter.
